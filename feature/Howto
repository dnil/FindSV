add files containing genmic features to this folder. The files should be arranged in the following way:
chrW	startpos	endpos	geneX
chrZ	startpos	endpos	geney

the files should be saved with the extension bed,txt or tab

Do not add other files with those extensions to the feature folder, otherwise they will be loaded into the pipeline aswell.

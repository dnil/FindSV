Runt the install script after downloading the FindSV pipeline, note the programfiles folder must be the working directory or the installation of vep wont work

The script runs the following command to install VEP:
perl INSTALL.pl --AUTO ac --s homo_sapiens --ASSEMBLY GRCh37
thus, to analyse other species than humans, the --s option aswell as
the --ASSEMBLY option should be changed accordingly.
